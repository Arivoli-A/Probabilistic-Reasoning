# Probabilistic Reasoning and Decision Making

This repository contains experiments and implementations related to **probabilistic reasoning and decision-making**, developed as part of the course **CSE 250A: Principles of Artificial Intelligence — Probabilistic Reasoning and Decision Making** at **UC San Diego**, taught by **Professor Trevor Bonjour**.

## Techniques and Topics Explored

1. **Bayesian Inference**
2. **Belief Networks** – including **D-Separation** for independence analysis
3. **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)** – with the **Viterbi Algorithm** for decoding sequences
4. **Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm**
5. **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**

...and more.
